## Project Overview

This project was completed as part of the *Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate* Capstone. The objective of the case study was to apply the complete data analysis process to a real-world business scenario and generate actionable insights for *Cyclistic*, a fictional bike-share company based in Chicago.

The project involved working with actual historical trip data provided by Cyclistic to understand customer behaviors and provide data-driven recommendations for increasing the number of annual memberships.

## My Learning Journey

### 1. Google Sheets & Excel — Powerful Everyday Tools
Initially, I underestimated Google Sheets and Excel. However, during the project, I learned advanced techniques in data cleaning, filtering, and quick analysis that made these tools highly effective for smaller datasets.

### 2. SQL — Unlocking the Power of Databases
Learning SQL through BigQuery Sandbox and setting up MySQL locally gave me a solid understanding of how to manage and query large datasets efficiently. Writing queries and transforming data became an exciting part of the process.

### 4. Communicating Insights — The Human Side of Data
While I love the technical side of analytics, learning to present my findings effectively was an essential skill. Crafting presentations in PowerPoint and Google Slides taught me how to tell a clear and compelling story to stakeholders.

### 5. R Programming — The Ultimate Playground
Exploring R felt like combining all my skills into one place. From cleaning and transforming data to visualizing and reporting, R provided endless possibilities and flexibility. I spent hours experimenting with different functions and packages, realizing that R could act as an all-in-one solution for data analysis.
