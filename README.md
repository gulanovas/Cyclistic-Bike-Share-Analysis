# Cyclistic-Bike-Share-Analysis
This project analyzes Cyclisticâ€™s bike-share data to uncover trends in rider behavior and provide data-driven recommendations for marketing strategies. The goal was to compare casual riders (single-ride or day-pass users) and annual members to identify opportunities for converting casual users into members.
